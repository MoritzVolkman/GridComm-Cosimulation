# Co-Simulation of Power Grid and Communication Network
## for the Master Thesis of Moritz Volkmann

To run the NetSim, do the following in the terminal:
```bash
cp NetSim.cc Path/to/ns3/scratch/NetSim.cc
Path/to/ns3 run scratch/NetSim.cc
```
### NetSim.py is deprecated and does not work properly, since some of the functionalities did not work in the ns-3 Python version

This is how the Program should work once it is finished:
